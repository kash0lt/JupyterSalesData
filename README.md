# JupyterSalesData
## using a macOS I created a virtual environment using my system default packages.

Under this virtual environment [source ./bin/activate] I used pip to add the packages this Sales analysis would require...pandas, matplotlib, numpy, jupyter to name a few. Once installed, you can then open jupyter notebook and access the web page that runs the TestAnalysis jupyter notebook.

Later, I used file->export python to grab the python code and save it as well.
