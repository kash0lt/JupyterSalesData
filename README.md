# JupyterSalesData
## Using a macOS I created a virtual environment...

Under this virtual environment [source ./bin/activate] I used pip to add the packages this Sales analysis would require...pandas, matplotlib, numpy, jupyter to name a few. Once installed, you can then open jupyter notebook and access the web page that runs the TestAnalysis jupyter notebook.

Later, I used file->export python to grab the python code and save it as well.

This was a very fun exercise into using notebook under jupyter to actually write and see the results of python code somewhat interactively. You can write a few lines, execute them, see the results in a web page. Very interesting.
